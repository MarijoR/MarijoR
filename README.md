# Marijo Radman

I work on **liquidity, market structure, and risk** in crypto markets.

My focus is not price or narratives, but how pressure accumulates inside systems through margin, funding, collateral constraints, and settlement design—and how that pressure resolves when choice disappears.

I currently build research and infrastructure at **[@alterscope](https://github.com/alterscope)**. Alongside this, I publish and speak about recurring liquidity failure modes across market cycles. Also researching synthetic data generation for robotics applications.

This profile is used to share first-principles thinking on market structure; not commentary or market calls.
